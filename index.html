        Whenever one of my children reaches a milestone, I become hopelessly teary. Tears of joy? I don’t think so. My
        tears are for a moment so precious and fleeting that I fear it may be lost. It’s a confusing place in the
        sad-to-happy range that makes me strangely gloomy.</p>

        The cream-soda-and-raspberry cupcakes came out of such a bittersweet moment. They were created last year to
        celebrate the 10th birthday of a Syrian refugee making her way across Europe. The girl, called Amal, which means
        hope in Arabic, was actually an 11-foot-tall puppet. Her makers wanted to bring to life the experience of
        millions of displaced children by creating a live art event called “The Walk.” They set Amal on a 5,000-mile
        journey, all the way from near the Turkish-Syrian border to Manchester, England, walking through more than 70
        cities. Wherever she went, Amal was greeted by crowds of children and adults, eager to see her, shake her hand
        and offer her company.</p>
